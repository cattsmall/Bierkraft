At first glance, beer brewing can look like an intimidating hobby. There are copious amounts of water to be dealt with, pounds worth of ingredients and specific times to add your malts and hops to attain certain characteristics to your beer.

![This is an image](/blog/images/item2.jpeg) However when you break it down, it’s no more difficult than simmering a soup. You gather and prepare the ingredients (mis en place if you will), determine boiling periods and control your heat. The biggest difference of course is the fermentation process which is the time when yeasts break down the sugars in your wert so you get that wonderful ethanol.

The ladies of bitches brew are happy to walk you through our first venture in brewing a Pale Ale. Our style isn’t a traditional English style (dry and hoppy) or even American style (dry and even hoppier). We’re making our Pale Ale Brooklyn style. And I’ll be able to tell you a far more detailed description of what that tastes like once our brew is bottled and ready for consumption.

Since our brothers at Bierkraft have been avid homebrewers for years, we’re lucky enough to have a Sabco System at our disposal.
